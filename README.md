# ethereum-price-prediction

This project is defined to predict high-fluctuation Ethereum price using deep recurrent neural network.
The dataset of some important parameters is collected from https://etherscan.io, since 2015.

## Conclusion

Crypto-currency price prediction is an OK exercise, but not good at all when applied to real world data, because the time variable is not causal.
